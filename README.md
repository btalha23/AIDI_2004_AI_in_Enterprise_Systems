## Lab #2 - Git, Github, & Gitlab
This lab focused on practicing git commands as well as getting more familiarity with Github. The task was to build two ML models by writing Python code in a Jupyter notebook. Train the models with the provided dataset as well as test & evaluate the built models. 

The two ML models utilized in this lab were

1. Random Forest Regression
2. Decision Tree Regression

Important to highlight here is that King County Housing dataset was exploited in this task. In contrast to the Breast Cancer dataset that was provided with the task. The reason of using another dataset than the provided one was that building the models were encountering issues with this dataset. The errors have been documented in the lab report and the used Python notebook is available in this repo.
